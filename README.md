Hey ðŸ‘‹ my name's Jorgen, I live in Vancouver, Canada, and I've been building **great product experiences** since ~2012.

Nice people have referred to me as **"the fullest stack" full stack** they know, because of my chops in product design as well as in front-end and back-end development.

Through my business **Buildnode Digital** I specialize in rapid production of outstanding web products using processes I've spent a decade fine-tuning.

I subcontract to excellent design and development talent to scale projects without compromising quality. I'm always looking for new collaborators, so if you'd like to work together please reach out.
